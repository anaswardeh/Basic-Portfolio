            Hello and welcome,
            <p>
                My name is Mohammed; it is a popular name that makes me proud. It means the grateful person.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am originally from the old city of Damascus. This city is mentioned in the Holy Bible. It is the first capital the world has ever known.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prophecies say that Jesus Christ will descend back to earth and the East Minaret of Damascus will be his first destination on earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before the war, Syrians were known of being very good at trading. We just love trading. We love to buy and sell, it just runs in the traditions of being from Damascus. That's why it's very difficult to sell an old Damascene woman because they love to bargain and negotiate every deal in this world - even at Macy's, they do negotiate prices "speaking from a personal experience."
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I had a totally different passion other than buying and selling merchandises and properties. Since I was a little boy, my passion was all about technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1995, I was 13 years old. I used to work as a typewriter at a business center that uses computers to process documents. I used to typewrite attorneys narratives and statements using MS. Word 95 on a Windows 3.1x Operating System. When the system crashes, I used to MS-DOS 6.22 Installer Floppy Images and Windows 3.1 Installer Floppy Images to reinstall a cleaner version. It was like magic to me. I used to spend hours playing Minesweeper, FreeCell and Solitaire.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2000, I attended my first bootcamp in Oracle 8<i>i</i> DBA and Developer courses in Damascus. It was a cutting-edge technology at the time. Our course was taught by a German Computer Engineer. The course cost was about $1000, which used to be a fortune in Damascus. Then I worked as an Assistant DBA at an international private school in Damascus.
            </p>
            <p>
                On 2005, I travelled to Switzerland to work at the International Telecommunication Union. It is a United Nations specialized agency. On 2007, I moved to the United States to work at the United Nations headquarters in New York. I was newly married and I was just discovering the taste of the real life.
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked several jobs at the United Nations: a Desktop and Publishing Assistant for the Arabic Unit; an Application Developer; an Information Systems assistant; and currently, I am working as a Web Developer. During my 10 years tenure at the UN, my passion did not fade or subside. After I finished my BA in English Literature, I studied a Master's in Computer Information Systems. My major was in Database Administration and Business Intillegence.
            </p>
            <p>
                On 2016, I joined the United States armed forces. When I say that I love America, it is an understatment. At the Army, I have been trained to competency at what I do. The military has sharpened my rough edges, it made me a better person and taught me many, many lessons at life. They were very tough and expensive lessons that either made me smarter or made me stronger.
            </p>
            <p>
                On a personal level, I am a spontaneous person. I have very good intentions to all people. I might say or do things that people might or might not like but I am who I am. I love scuba diving, shooting, swimming, running, I love coding and making things look or do better, I love milling and I love assembling electronic circuts. Yes, I might look like a boring person but I always add fun to my somewhat rigid activites. My wife tells me that I resemble the tiger's character.
